- modify finds
- change " --> '
- break up big/complex functions
- make a get data --> save it function ???


do updates
- use more complex data structures (more dicts?) to help store values clearly!
- also, make better functions!!! sometimes, fewer but longer functions is good! separate on how tasks break apart...


do
- write clever tasks
- write glacier task
    - go to glacier for "advanced"? write your own Luigi task... S3 for basic...
- panopto: grab slides (change "wait")
    - the "thumbnails" are actually the full image files and the time stamps are all correct!


logistics
- add docstrings to code
- readme
	- add setup instructions (note that only chrome/chromeium can be used!)
	- add explanation
- write tests as needed...

note: the final project you submit can be different from the code you use! be smart with this!
