do
- panopto: grab slides (change "wait")
    - the "thumbnails" are actually the full image files and the time stamps are all correct!
    - complex dicts for this!!!
- write a command line tool to work with this
    - commands
        - download_lectures
        - upload_lectures
    - instructions
        - put canvas username/password in .env
        - put aws info in .env
    - input
        - canvas lecture page
    - flags
        - allow overrides for VIDEO_PATH and S3_ROOT
        - add timeout_max flag (no flag assumes full videos)

- add nicer progress bars!

get this "do" done! finish the project by thrusday!



logistics
- add docstrings to code
- readme
	- add setup instructions (note that only chrome/chromeium can be used!)
	- add explanation
        - rough outline of code
- (be lazy!!!) write some tests

note: the final project you submit can be different from the code you use! be smart with this!
